It's a 2-d platformer game I made which includes GUI( for example, login pages, level select pages and even a registration system which sends emails to the player when signing up for the first time)
, sound effects, background music, 3 levels, a wide range of enemies with some of them having multiple movesets, an attack and hp system; and also a leaderboard system(, stored on a local database) which was created using db.browser. The game also allows the player to swap between two playable characters
